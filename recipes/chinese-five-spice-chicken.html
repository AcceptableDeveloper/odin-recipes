    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Cut the chicken and Marinade</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut the skin-on whole chicken into big pieces. If you are using pre-cut chicken, you can skip this step.</li>
      <li>
        Pat dry the chicken with a paper towel to remove excess moisture and trim off excess fat. Cut the legs off by the joint between the body and thigh. Remove the backbone by using kitchen scissors. Cut the wings part through the natural joint. Place the chicken breast side down and press down
        with a knife at the center of the cartilage and breast bone. Flip and cut through the chicken breast skin in the middle. See detailed in photo and video instructions.
      </li>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl add all the marinade ingredients and whisk everything well. Then add the cut chicken pieces and coat each chicken piece with the marinade sauce mix. Then cover it with the cling film and keep it in the fridge for at least 1 hour or overnight.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Roast in Oven</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Take the marinated chicken out of the fridge and leave it at room temperature for about 30 minutes before adding it to the oven. Cover the baking tray with kitchen foil and place the rack over it.</li>
      <li>Place the chicken pieces skin-side up on the rack, and add the tray in the middle of the oven. Leave to bake in the preheated oven at 180&deg;C (350&deg;F ) for 25-30 minutes. .</li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, the chicken is roasting you can prepare the basting sauce. In a small pot, add the leftover sauce from the chicken marinade. Then add honey, cooking oil, and water. Heat the pot to boil then lower the heat and simmer for 1-2 minutes or until the sauce starts to get thickened.
      </li>
      <li>Then remove it from heat and set it aside. After 30 minutes of baking, baste each chicken piece with the basting sauce. Then place it in the oven and continue roasting at 180&deg;C (350&deg;F ) for another 15-20 minutes or until the chicken is cooked.</li>
      <li>Brush with the basting sauce and chop into medium slices or pieces. Enjoy with steamed rice and blanched vegetables.</li>
